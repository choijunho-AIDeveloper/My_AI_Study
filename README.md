# MY_AI_StudyNote
## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey and insights as AI studies. 

## Overview
My first step in this journey is exploring "Dive into Deep Learning" by a team of four authors, including Aston Zhang.
This repository serves as my study notebook, where I record learnings, code exercises, and notes for future reference.
This is also my first GitHub project, aimed at familiarizing myself with using GitHub effectively for personal and collaborative projects.

## In Closing
Thank you for taking the time to look through my work! :)
